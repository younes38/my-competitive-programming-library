## notes
- the library is still in its first version.
- some of the algorithms are not tested.

## TODO
- add explanatory comments for each algorithm/data structure
- add more algorithm/data structure implemetations

## references
- The structure of the files and some algorithms are inspired from [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/).
